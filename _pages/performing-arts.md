* *[Ivona, Princess of Burgundy](https://www.toneelhuis.be/nl/programma/yvonne-prinses-van-bourgondie/)*, Tibaldus / Toneelhuis
<img src="../images/yvonne.jpg" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
"*The story of Princess Ivona is a very strange tale indeed, based on the mock-Shakespearean 1938 drama of the same name by the great Polish absurdist Wiltold Gombrowicz; and it forms the basis for what is, in its quiet way, one of the most unexpected shows on this yearâ€™s fringe. (...)  The role of Ivona is brilliantly and startlingly played by David van Dijcke, a towering, well-muscled male dancer who becomes Ivona simply by shutting down his facial expression, and adopting an unmistakable dragging limp.*"
