Welcome to my webpage. 

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. You can find a great overview of my recent research by Michigan News [here](https://news.umich.edu/u-m-economic-expert-others-find-views-on-politics-science-have-driven-public-response-to-pandemic/).
I am also an Academic Visitor at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/).

My [research](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/research) interests lie in industrial organization, political economy, and econometrics.

I believe in open science and data sharing. Feel free to bother me with code or data questions.

Please find my [CV](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/cv) here. 

To make sure I was well-prepared for a career in economics, I got a BA in theatre. You can find evidence of my knowledge of real analysis [here](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts).
