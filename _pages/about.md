Welcome to my webpage. 

I am a DPhil (PRS) in Economics at the University of Oxford. Conceptually, I am interested in how different kinds of firms interact with different kinds of workers, and how this affects macroeconomic dynamics and outcomes. Methodologically, I am enthusiastic about the potential of large-scale micro data to shed light on questions about the economy and society at large. I believe in open science and open source. Feel free to bother me with data and code questions and requests.

My [research](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/research) fields are: macroeconomics, industrial organization, labor economics.

My research interests are: market power, firm and household heterogeneity, inequality, big data.


Please find my [CV](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/cv) here.

Before turning to economics, I worked in the performing arts. You can find some excerpts at the [Performing Arts](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts) tab.
