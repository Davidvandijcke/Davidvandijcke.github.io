Welcome to my webpage. 

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. 
I am also an Academic Visitor at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/) and an Honorary Fellow of the [Belgian American Education Foundation](http://www.baef.be/documents/home.xml). 

My [research](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/research) interests lie in industrial organization, econometrics and political economy.

I believe in open science and data sharing. Feel free to bother me with code or data questions.

Please find my [CV](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/cv) here.

Before turning to economics, I worked in the performing arts. You can find some excerpts at the [Performing Arts](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts) tab.
