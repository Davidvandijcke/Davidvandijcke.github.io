Welcome to my webpage. 

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. You can find a great overview of my recent research by Michigan News [here](https://news.umich.edu/u-m-economic-expert-others-find-views-on-politics-science-have-driven-public-response-to-pandemic/).

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am also an Academic Visitor at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/).

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/>  My [research](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/research) interests lie in industrial organization, political economy, and econometrics.


<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/>  You can book a meeting with me via [this link](https://calendar.app.google/dKeDaigmFwnJPm8s6). 


<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/>  Please find my [CV](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/cv) here. 


<sup></sup>To make sure I was well-prepared for a career in economics, I got a BA in theatre. You can find the evidence [here](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts). <sup></sup>
