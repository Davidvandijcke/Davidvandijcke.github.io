Welcome to my webpage. Feel free to look around. 

I am a DPhil Student (PRS) in Economics at the University of Oxford. 

My [research](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/research) interests are: macroeconomics and monetary economics, firm and agent heterogeneity, inequality, and climate change.

Please find my [CV](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/cv) here.

Before turning to economics, I worked in the performing arts. You can find some excerpts at the [Performing Arts](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts) tab.
