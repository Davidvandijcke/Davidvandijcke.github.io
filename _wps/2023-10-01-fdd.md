title: "Free Discontinuity Regression: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns"
collection: wps
permalink: /wp/2023-10-01-fdd
coauthors: Florian Gunsilius
excerpt: 'Discontinuities in regression functions can reveal important insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, such discontinuities are multivariate and unknown a
priori. We propose a non-parametric regression method that estimates the location
and size of discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface. This estimator is
based on a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish
identification and convergence. We use it to show that an internet shutdown in India
resulted in a reduction of economic activity by 25Ð35%, greatly surpassing previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns for digital economies
globally.'

Discontinuities in regression functions can reveal important insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, such discontinuities are multivariate and unknown a
priori. We propose a non-parametric regression method that estimates the location
and size of discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface. This estimator is
based on a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish
identification and convergence. We use it to show that an internet shutdown in India
resulted in a reduction of economic activity by 25Ð35%, greatly surpassing previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns for digital economies
