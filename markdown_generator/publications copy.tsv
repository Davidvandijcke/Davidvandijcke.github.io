To that end, it uses a panel survey from the Dutch central bank to decompose the contributions of selected UMP channels to the change in household income between two periods (11-13 / 14-16). It finds that UMP's effect through these channels was strongly equalizing. The only two other papers on the topic find similar results for other euro area countries."	"Van Dijcke, D. (2018).

99-99-9999	"Leaning Against the Wind When Inequality Bites Back: Financial Stability, Monetary Policy and Inequality"	NA	"This thesis studies the links between monetary policy, inequality, leverage and financial crises in a Bayesian VAR analysis of a panel of advanced inflation-targeting economies, wherein the policy rate is adjusted for the zero lower bound by means of shadow rate estimates. That way, it finds that monetary policy’s ability to foster financial stability by leaning against a build-up in leverage is significantly hampered by that policy’s distributional side-effects. Specifically, both discretionary and systematic contractionary monetary policy are found to increase inequality. As inequality is in turn found to be cointegrated with leverage, contractionary monetary policy’s efforts to curb the credit cycle are shown to be partially self-defeating, besides leading to welfare losses in the form of both decreased output and increased inequality"	NA	paper-title-number-3	http://davidvandijcke.github.io/files/LeaningAgainstTheWindWhenInequalityBitesBack.pdf
99-99-9999	Work Effort and the Cycle: Evidence from Survey Data	Bundesbank Discussion Paper	"We use data from the World Values Survey and the Work Orientations Survey to analyse the cyclical nature of work effort and attitudes to work effort. Our aim is to test two competing theories of labor effort, the labor hoarding view and the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) ‘shirking model’. Self-reported work effort is found to be strongly procyclical, while attitudes to effort move slightly countercyclically. We provide evidence for the presence of labor hoarding by showing how the cyclicality of effort changes with the strictness of employment protection legislation. Finally, we document heterogeneity in effort cyclicality across occupations and individuals."	"Lewis, V. and Van Dijcke, D. (2019). Work Effort and the Cycle: Evidence from Survey Data.
